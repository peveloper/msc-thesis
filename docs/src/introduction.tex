\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

According to the latest Cisco's VNI \cite{video-traffic-forecast}, video will
account for 82\% of all IP traffic in Europe by 2021; moreover the overall IP
traffic per person will triplicate from 13\emph{GB} to 35\emph{GB}. These
forecast clearly picture the growth of the streaming industry, posing, at the
same time an important question on the present and future states of the final
user's privacy.

As shown by Reed et Al. \cite{netflix-real-time} anonimity of user's viewing
activity is at risk. Not for the use that Netflix or other streaming services
do of user's session data, but because of the risk of a man-in-the-middle
attack \emph{MITM} by an \textit{evil} party. 

In particular, they have shown how the adoption of HTTPS to protect video
streams from Netflix \emph{CDN}s to user's end devices, does not hold against
passive traffic analysis.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

Our intent is to replicate the work of Reed et Al. and to observe if recent
changes in Netflix infrastructure can guarantee anonimity of user's viewing
activity.
