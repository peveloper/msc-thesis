\chapter{Approach}\label{sec:approach}

After having shown the perspective of an ISP in the role of an attacker, we
will now present our contribution and practical approach to build a database of
fingerprints, capture and identify video traffic streamed by an unaware user
over a compromised network. 

\section{Attack Scenario}

Our own version of the attack, conversely to the one depicted in
\Cref{fig:schema}, does not model the ISP as the adversary, nor does involve
the ISP at all. We consider the case in which attacker is a malicious user
\emph{i}, with access to the network an honest client is using to stream a
Netflix title. Attacker \emph{i} has:

\begin{itemize}
    \item either installed a passive TAP device on a LAN
    \item or gained control of the main switch of a LAN
    \item or compromised an AP over a public WiFi network.
\end{itemize}
